# Planned Features

- PDF(and other formats?) character sheet export
- Extendable character creation (orcbrew files)
- Create custom content (export as orcbrew)
- Online character storage (maybe, Django is capable of this, but I'm not sure I want to take on user and auth stuff)
- Light/Dark theme (CSS variables? are these something I can use with Bulma?)
- Responsive Character Sheet updating.

# Stack

- Django
